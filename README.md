# Node.js Server for React Native Application

This repository contains the server-side code for my React Native application. It is powered by Node.js and uses popular libraries and frameworks to handle the backend functionality.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system
- NPM (Node Package Manager) installed
- A database solution (MongoDB) set up and configured.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/wujekbizon/aws-lockers-server.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory using `cd <project-directory>`.
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Configure your database settings by creating a `.env` file in the root directory and add required credentials. You can use `.env.example` file as a template.
5. Start the server locally using available scripts.
6. The server will be running on `http://localhost:5100` by default.

## Available Scripts

- `npm start`: Starts the server in production mode.
- `npm run dev`: Starts the server in development mode using `nodemon`.
- `npm run watch`: Starts the server in development using build in node watch mode
